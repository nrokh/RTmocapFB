about these data:

S01
- s01_baselinemeanFPA.csv was pulled from Keeper as: /FeedbackStudy/s01/DAY2_2024APR08/baseline_walking/s01_baselinemeanFPA2.csv 
- s01_meanFPA{2,3,4}.csv and s01_retentionmeanFPA.csv were pulled from Keeper: /FeedbackStudy/s01/DAY2_2024APR08/walking_trials
***NOTE: s01_meanFPA1.csv does not exist, as the GG battery died. We could reprocess the data from mocap, but we have no timestamp for when the GG stopped providing feedback, so it's not very useful. 

s02
- s02_baselinemeanFPA.csv and s02_retentionFPA were pulled from Keeper: /FeedbackStudy/s02/DAY2_2024APR09/
- s02_meanFPA{1,2,3,4}.csv were pulled from Keeper where the numbering was [], _1, _2, _3.
