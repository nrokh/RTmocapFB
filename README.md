# Real-time Motion Capture Feedback
To do:
* GG battery life testing
* GG battery status implementation
* finalize recruitment emails and poster

Changes after pilot testing:
* change BORG to after every toe-in 
* catch trials at 40 steps (20 on right side) (maybe centered at halfway point)
* add open-ended survey prompt to LimeSurvey for switch responses
* one minute minimum for testing switch condition but let them try it for as long as desired
* (maybe) make vibrotactile duration test harder
* revise survey Qs based on feedback for what wasn't clear
*  ask KJK if we want to include smokers in study

Completed:
* set subject numbering, file structure, saving protocol
* find adjustable chair
* modify the matlab GUI with better buttons
* add info to the empatica info sheet
* check that files are saving correctly
* cut new base for proprioception trial
* update experimental plan
* add catch trials at set number of steps 
* create matlab script to compare p-p acc across days
* remove plotting from vb test matlab script
* split matlab scripts into recording acc/testing sensitivity
* add stdev to final error (retention)
* proprio code: add coordinates for reference angles for proprio, fix marker labeling, add pseudorandom presentation, add ankle marker
* add retention trial
* add timeout for toe-in trial (5 min)
* add timestamp for when we started feedback
* Streaming marker data via Python Nexus SDK
* Computing foot progression angle in the direction of gait progression
* Triggering haptic cue to the GaitGuide via Bluetooth
* Integrate step-detection script into feedback loop
* Add error catching for when a marker is occluded
* Combine haptic triggers with feedback loop
* Craft baseline FPA estimation script
* Set naming and saving conventions, folder structure
* Test feedback scaling slope
* Pilot test vibrotactile sensitivity ML App
* Write Python script for Vicon for proprioceptive sensitivity test
* Pilot test proprioceptive sensitivity
* add L and R sides to vibro sensitivity testing
* get metronome app
* Quantify delay/estimate how long it takes to detect a step and send a command
* Run pilot trial start to finish
