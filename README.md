# Real-time Motion Capture Feedback
Completed:
* Streaming marker data via Python Nexus SDK
* Computing foot progression angle in the direction of gait progression
* Triggering haptic cue to the GaitGuide via Bluetooth
* Integrate step-detection script into feedback loop
* Add error catching for when a marker is occluded
* Combine haptic triggers with feedback loop
* Craft baseline FPA estimation script

To do:
* Test feedback scaling slope 
* Quantify delay/estimate how long it takes to detect a step and send a command
* Set naming and saving conventions, folder structure
* Run pilot trial start to finish
